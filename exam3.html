Dear Dr,\n
Re: Mrs Heather French, Age 34 years\n
I saw this woman in my surgery requesting contraception. She wanted to go on the combined oral contraceptive pill. Her history is very complicated and I was not comfortable starting her on this. I would be grateful if you could see and offer her the best option. The family planning services are too far from here, and hence I am referring her to the gynaecology clinic.
\n
Yours sincerely\n
Dr Sanjay Prabhu MBChB, FRCGP\n`,

A urodynamic study was performed before her clinic appointment (see Fig 19.1). Amanda wishes to know more about the urodynamic findings and management options available to her. You will have ten minutes for the initial discussion. Once you have finished discussion with Amanda the assessor will ask you some questions.
